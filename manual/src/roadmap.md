# Roadmap

There are **plenty** of things not yet implementing, missing, or broken. Here is a list of things that are planned to be implemented in the future:

- [ ] **More of WASM**: Support more WASM instructions and features.
- [ ] **Scheduler**: Implement a scheduler to run multiple threads concurrently.
- [ ] **Debug Tooling**: OS development should be fun and easy. Develop *k23* specific debug tooling to make working on the OS a breeze.
- [ ] **IPC**: Implement Inter-Process Communication.
- [ ] **WASM Components**: Support the WASM components proposal, a requirement for proper microkernel modularity.
- [ ] **Component Registry & Basic Package Manager**: Using the WASM components registry proposal, implement a basic package manager to install and run components dynamically.
- [ ] **Capability System**: Implement a capability based security system for interacting with OS functionality and drivers
- [ ] **WASI Support**: Support the WebAssembly System Interface specification for accessing things like the network, file system and more.

This list is not exhaustive and will be updated as development progresses. If you would like to discuss the roadmap items above or have suggestions, please open a dicussion on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JonasKruckenberg/k23).
